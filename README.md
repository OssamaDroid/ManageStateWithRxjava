# ManageStateWithRxjava
This is a sample application which explicits how to manage the Application state using RxJava. The idea behind this pattern is taken from **Jake Wharton's** [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IKHxjkgop4) titled **Managing State with RxJava**. This sample app is more like the output of all the ideas from the talk.

The purpose of creating such an application is to make it easier for developers who want to understand how this pattern work in a real application and maybe push this concept further.

For simplicity, the app uses **Kotlin** and the following libraries **RxJava**, **RxAndroid**, and **RxBinding**

I have also posted this [article](https://medium.com/@OssamaDroid/key-takeaways-from-managing-state-with-rxjava-by-jake-wharton-337ec54ff742) on Medium to explain the concept further.
